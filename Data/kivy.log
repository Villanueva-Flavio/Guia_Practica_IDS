# HOW TO DEBUG 


(Instructions for Windows 11)


1) Install USB drivers for your phone

Example Samsung: https://developer.samsung.com/android-usb-driver

The drivers are different for each phone brand: Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, etc.


2) Install "Minimal ADB and Fastboot" --> latest version

4) Open program "Minimal ADB and Fastboot" on PowerShell console

    * Start Menu --> type "powershell" --> enter
    * in console:
        cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Minimal ADB and Fastboot"


5) Connect phone to PC using USB cable

    * In your phone, a message will appear: "Allow USB debugging?"
        * Check option "Always allow from this computer"
        * Tap "Allow"


6) Check phone is detected by the PC

    * In powershell console execute the command:
        
        adb devices
    
    * A message like this has to appear in the console:

        List of devices attached
        RF8R60HZ53J     device


7) Open Android Logcat using a regex to detect specific logs from your phone

    Examples:


    // All logs

    adb logcat


    // All logs from time "11:21" for app "org.test.myapp"

    adb logcat | Select-String -Pattern '^(.*)11\:21(.*)org.test.myapp(.*)$'


    // "W"/"E"/"F" logs from time "11:21" for app "org.test.myapp"
    // https://developer.android.com/tools/logcat#filteringOutput

    adb logcat | Select-String -Pattern "^(.*)11\:21(.*)\s(W|E|F)\s(.*)org.test.myapp(.*)$"


8) In your phone, open the app to see the logs on powershell console

    Example of logcat output in PowerShell console (from your phone):
